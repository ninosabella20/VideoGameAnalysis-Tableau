# ðŸ“Š Video Game Sales Analysis with Tableau

### Author: Nino Sabella

## Overview

This project showcases an analysis of video game sales data sourced from the [Kaggle Video Game Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales). The objective is to display my proficiency in data visualization using **Tableau**, demonstrating key insights into global video game sales trends across various dimensions such as genre, platform, and regional popularity.

The Tableau dashboard tells a story in four main sections:

1. **Global Video Game Sales by Genre Over Time**
2. **Most Popular Video Game Platforms Globally**
3. **Global Sales for the Top 25 Video Games**
4. **Top 5 Video Games for Each Region** (NA, EU, JP, Other)

## Project Details

### 1. Global Video Game Sales by Genre Over Time
In this section, I explore how global video game sales have evolved across different genres over time. The visualization demonstrates the trends and the most successful genres in various time periods. It answers questions like:
- Which genres have grown the most in popularity?
- Are there any genres that have experienced a decline in sales?

### 2. Most Popular Video Game Platforms Globally
This visualization focuses on identifying the most successful video game platforms based on total sales. It provides a global overview of platform popularity across different generations of gaming consoles and answers questions such as:
- Which platforms have dominated the global market?
- How has platform popularity shifted over time?

### 3. Global Sales for the Top 25 Video Games
This part of the analysis highlights the global sales figures for the top 25 video games of all time. It provides insight into:
- Which games have sold the most copies worldwide?
- What factors may have contributed to the success of these top-performing games?

### 4. Top 5 Video Games for Each Region (NA, EU, JP, Other)
In this final section, I delve into the top 5 video games for each of the following regions: North America, Europe, Japan, and the rest of the world. The visualization breaks down regional preferences, providing a more localized view of video game popularity. This section answers:
- Which games resonate the most in each region?
- Are there significant differences in video game preferences between regions?
